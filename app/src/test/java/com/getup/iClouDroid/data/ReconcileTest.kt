 *
 * This is the riskiest logic in the app: it is the only place a photo the user can still see on
 * another device may disappear locally. Two properties matter and both are asserted here:
 *
 *  - a row whose *master* is still returned is kept, even if its own asset id is gone (the
 *    conservative rule — several `CPLAsset` records can share one `CPLMaster`);
 *  - a walk that returned implausibly little is refused outright rather than trusted.
