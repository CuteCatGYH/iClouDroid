/**
 * Pins the staleness rule used by `ICloudPhotoInterceptor` after P2-019.
 *
 * Before the fix a session-generation mismatch alone forced a URL re-mint. Measurement on a
 * physical device (`.artifacts/url_lifetime_experiment.md`) showed that is wrong on both counts:
 *
 *  - a URL stays valid across a full session rebuild (206 after generation N → N+1), so a plain
 *    mismatch is not evidence of a dead link;
 *  - real expiry happens at ~15–18 minutes (206 at 882s, 410 at 1065s), far sooner than the
 *    45-minute window the code used, so age is the signal that actually matters.
 *
 * The rule now: re-mint when the URL is missing, or older than the max age, or (when the
 * generation also moved) older than half the max age.
