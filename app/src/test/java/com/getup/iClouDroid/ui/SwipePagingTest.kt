/**
 * The commit rule for a finished horizontal swipe.
 *
 * ## Sign convention — measured, not assumed
 *
 * This was got wrong several times, so the convention is pinned down here and verified against a
 * device. Logging `calculatePan().x` per frame during a leftward swipe reported about **-11.5
 * every frame**, totalling `-544` for a full-width drag. So:
 *
 * ```
 * negative totalDragX = swiped left  = NEXT photo
 * positive totalDragX = swiped right = PREVIOUS photo
 * ```
 *
 * ## Direction vs. velocity
 *
 * `totalDragX` alone decides direction. `velocityMagnitude` is a non-negative "how fast was it",
 * and is never allowed to pick the direction: `calculatePan` and `VelocityTracker` report opposite
 * signs, so letting them both contribute a sign is how the direction kept flipping. A decisive
 * flick (magnitude above the threshold) commits without needing the distance; a slow drag needs to
 * cover a quarter of the screen.
