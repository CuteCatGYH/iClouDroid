/**
 * Controls the system bars for the full-screen viewer.
 *
 * ## Two distinct states, deliberately different
 *
 *  - **Full screen** ([immersive] = false): the status bar stays visible. The user still wants the
 *    clock, battery and notifications while browsing photos. Only the *app's* chrome (top bar,
 *    bottom navigation) goes away — that is handled by the callers, not here.
 *  - **Immersive** ([immersive] = true): the photo is the only thing on screen, so the status bar
 *    and navigation bar are hidden too.
 *
 * Hiding the status bar in the plain full-screen state (which an earlier version did) leaves a
 * blank strip where the clock should be and no way to check anything without leaving the viewer.
 *
 * ## Why the bars must be managed at all
 *
 * The viewer is rendered *inside* `PhotosScreen` → `AppShell`'s `Scaffold`. A `Box` that fills the
 * screen still only fills the area its ancestors gave it, so the system bars would overlap or inset
 * it. The app's own bars are removed by the callers; the system ones are removed here.
 *
 * Bars are restored on dispose, so leaving the viewer returns the app to a normal window. Restoring
 * explicitly matters because the activity is shared: if we merely stopped asking, the last
 * requested flags would stick.
