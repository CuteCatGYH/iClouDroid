/**
 * Hosts [SettingsScreen] and wires the system back gesture to it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a wrapper
 *
 * Settings is an **overlay**, not an Activity or a nav destination: opening it flips a boolean in
 * `AppShell`. Compose has no idea that means "a screen is on top", so without this the edge-swipe
 * gesture is delivered to `MainActivity` and the app simply closes.
 *
 * ## Predictive back
 *
 * A plain `BackHandler` would fix the "app closes" part but still be wrong: the system would show
 * its own preview (a shrinking snapshot) while our panel sat perfectly still until the finger
 * lifted. `PredictiveBackHandler` reports the gesture's progress continuously, so the panel can
 * slide and fade in step with the finger — the same treatment `PhotoViewerScreen` gives the photo
 * viewer.
 *
 * Only a translation + alpha is animated. Both are applied through `graphicsLayer`, so the panel
 * behind it never re-measures per frame — animating layout offsets here would re-lay-out the entire
 * settings list on every drag frame.
 *
 * ## Degradation
 *
 * If the platform does not support predictive back, `PredictiveBackHandler` never emits and the
 * `BackHandler` below still cancels the gesture correctly; the panel simply closes without a
 * finger-tracked preview. Nothing breaks either way.
