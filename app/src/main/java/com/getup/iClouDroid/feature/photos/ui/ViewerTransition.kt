/**
 * Remembers where each thumbnail currently sits in the window, so the viewer can open from that
 * exact rectangle and close back into it.
 *
 * ## Why the grid publishes its own geometry
 *
 * The alternative is a shared-element transition. Compose's `SharedTransitionLayout` would do this
 * declaratively, but it is still experimental on this Compose version and, more importantly, it
 * cannot cross the `Dialog`/`AndroidView` boundary — a constraint this viewer already had to work
 * around once. Publishing rectangles keeps the animation fully under our control: the grid reports
 * where a cell is, the viewer interpolates from there to full screen.
 *
 * The map is keyed by asset id and only holds cells that are currently laid out, so it stays small
 * (a screenful of thumbnails) even for a 15k-item library.

 *
 * Opening: the viewer's content starts as a rectangle matching the tapped thumbnail and grows to
 * fill the screen, while its own chrome fades in afterwards.
 *
 * Closing: the reverse — the content shrinks back into the thumbnail's rectangle.
 *
 * When the thumbnail is no longer on screen (the user swiped to a photo further down the month, or
 * scrolled the grid), there is nothing to return to. In that case the animation degrades to a
 * plain fade rather than flying to a wrong or off-screen rectangle, which would look like a glitch.
