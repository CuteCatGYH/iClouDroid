/**
 * One image page of the full-screen viewer, with a two-layer progressive reveal.
 *
 * ## Why two layers
 *
 * The old viewer showed a spinner until a full-size image arrived. That reads as "broken" on a
 * slow link, and the thumbnail the user just tapped was already decoded and sitting in Coil's
 * memory cache. So:
 *
 *  - **Base layer** asks for the *same* `THUMB` cache key the grid populated, with
 *    [ICloudImageModel.cacheOnly] set and both cache policies read-only. It hits memory almost
 *    always, costing no network at all, and paints immediately.
 *  - **Sharp layer** requests MEDIUM (or ORIGINAL after an explicit zoom) and is faded in once it
 *    resolves, over the base image. Nothing is ever shown as a spinner over an empty screen.
 *
 * ## What must NOT regress
 *
 * This page carries two behaviours that were expensive to get right:
 *
 *  1. **HDR degrade chain (ISS-023).** Apple's high-bit-depth originals (`16-bit PNG`, `10-bit
 *     HEVC`) fail to decode on Android entirely. On a decode failure — as opposed to a dead URL —
 *     the request drops to MEDIUM. The state flip is deferred by one frame (`withFrameNanos`),
 *     because mutating it inline from `onError` does not rebuild the AsyncImage: the callback runs
 *     while Coil is still finishing the failing request, and the new model would be swallowed.
 *     `isDegrading` covers that gap so the error panel is never painted in between.
 *
 *  2. **Dead-URL recovery (P2-004 / P2-011).** A 403/410 means the CDN signature aged out; that is
 *     worth exactly one re-mint. A decoder failure returns the same broken bytes however many new
 *     URLs are minted, so it must NOT burn a lookup (that was P2-011).
