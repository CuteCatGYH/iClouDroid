 * One year in the gallery jump panel, with a 12-slot availability mask.

 * selected year a fixed 3x4 grid of months. Months without photos stay in the grid — greyed out
 * and unclickable — because a grid whose cells move around as the library fills in is impossible
 * to aim at.
 *
 * Kept as plain data + pure functions (no Compose, no Room) so the grouping and stepping rules can
 * be unit tested; they are the part most likely to be silently wrong.
