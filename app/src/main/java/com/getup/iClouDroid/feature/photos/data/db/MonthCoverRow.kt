/**
 * One month plus its cover asset, as read by the gallery's jump card.
 *
 * ## Why a join instead of two queries
 *
 * Opening the jump card renders twelve cells for one year. Reading the index rows and then doing a
 * point lookup per month would be twelve round trips through Room on every open; a single
 * `photo_month_index LEFT JOIN photo_assets` costs one.
 *
 * ## Why the fields are nullable
 *
 * The join is a `LEFT JOIN` on `m.coverAssetId`, so three genuinely different situations all arrive
 * here with nulls, and the caller must tell them apart by *which* columns are null:
 *
 * | `coverAssetId` | `coverThumbUrl` | meaning |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | null | null | month has no photos, or was scanned with covers switched off |
 * | set | null | video without a `thumbUrl`, or URLs not minted yet → draw text, never fall back to `medUrl` |
 * | set | set | drawable cover |
 *
 * Collapsing these into a single nullable URL would lose the difference between "no photos" and
 * "photos, but nothing to show", which the UI renders differently (dimmed vs. text cell).
