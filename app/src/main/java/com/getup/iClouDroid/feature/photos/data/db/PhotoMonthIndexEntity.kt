/**
 * One row per month that has at least one photo (P2-016).
 *
 * This is the index the gallery actually scrolls over: the `LazyColumn` is built from these rows
 * (a few hundred at most) rather than from the tens of thousands of photo rows, and each month's
 * contents are subscribed separately. It also supplies the labels for the year/month jump bar
 * without touching `photo_assets` at all.
 *
 * The index is derived data — it can always be rebuilt from `photo_assets` — so keeping it in sync
 * is a cheap `SELECT ... GROUP BY yearMonth` after each scan batch rather than a source of truth.
