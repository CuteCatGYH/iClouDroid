/**
 * Walks the whole photo library once and buckets it into month sections (P2-016).
 *
 * ## Why this replaces Paging 3
 *
 * The old grid used `RemoteMediator` + Paging 3, and Paging 3 invalidates its `PagingSource` after
 * **every** successful APPEND. The reload window is `initialLoadSize`, so scrolling past it
 * clamped `firstVisibleItemIndex` and the list visibly jumped to the top (ISS-021). That is
 * inherent to `RemoteMediator`, not a tunable.
 *
 * This engine therefore does the fetching itself and writes plain rows to Room. The UI then reads
 * month sections from the database and has nothing to invalidate: the scroll anchor is a month
 * key, which does not change when rows are appended.
 *
 * ## Scan while browsing
 *
 * The cursor walks newest → oldest, so the first batches fill the most recent months. Each batch is
 * committed and its month index rebuilt immediately, which means the user can browse while the
 * rest of the library streams in.
