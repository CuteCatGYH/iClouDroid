/**
 * Floating time jump control for the gallery.
 *
 * ## Two states, one control
 *
 * **Collapsed** — a month capsule stacked over the up/down month steppers, vertically centred on
 * the right edge. It reports where you are, nudges you one month at a time, and is the only entry
 * point to the jump panel. The gallery's grid is never permanently narrowed by a strip of years.
 *
 * **Expanded** — the capsule grows into a single floating card anchored where the capsule was, and
 * the steppers step aside. The card holds the years in a vertical, scrollable column on its left
 * and the selected year's twelve months on its right.
 *
 * ## Why the years live in a `LazyColumn` inside a fixed-height card
 *
 * A library can span three years or twenty. A top-level list of years (one row each, no scroller)
 * would either be clipped at the screen edge or force the card to grow until it covers the gallery.
 * The card therefore has a **fixed maximum height** and the year list scrolls *inside* it, so
 * seventeen years and three years both produce the same card.
 *
 * The month grid is NOT lazy: it is always exactly twelve cells. Nesting a lazy grid inside the
 * year `LazyColumn` is what AGENTS §6.5 forbids — here it is a plain `Column` of `Row`s, which is
 * also cheaper than a scroll container that can never scroll.
 *
 * ## Anchoring
 *
 * Every read is driven by [currentYearMonth], which the caller derives from the list's
 * `firstVisibleItemKey` — **never** from a visible index. That is the P2-016 fix in one sentence:
 * a month key is stable across list rebuilds, an integer index is not.
 *
 * @param currentYearMonth the month at the top of the viewport, or null before the first layout.
 * @param months all months in the gallery, newest first.
 * @param onJumpToMonth called with the target month; the caller resolves it to a list position.
 * @param coverRowsOf resolves one year's cover rows, or null when the user has cover previews
 *   switched off. Null is not the same as "an empty flow": it selects the plain text grid and
 *   means the process never subscribed to the cover data at all.

 * The 12-cell month grid.

 * Two layouts behind one function, because they are the same thing at different levels of detail:
 *
 *  - **covers on** — 3 across x 4 down of 56dp thumbnails, the month number overlaid at the
 *    bottom. This is what makes \"jump to June\" a matter of recognising a picture.
 *  - **covers off** — 4 across x 3 down of plain text cells, i.e. exactly the old grid.
 *
 * Passing `cells == null` selects the text layout; the caller does that when the user has the
 * feature switched off, which is also what stops the covers being downloaded in the first place.
 *
 * Plain `Column` + `Row`s either way: a fixed grid gains nothing from being lazy, and nesting a
 * lazy layout inside the year `LazyColumn` is what AGENTS §6.5 warns about.
