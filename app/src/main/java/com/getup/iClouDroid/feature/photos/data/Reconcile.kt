/**
 * Pure reconciliation rules, separated from Room and CloudKit so they can be unit tested directly.
 *
 * ## Why a full diff at all
 *
 * CloudKit reports deletions in exactly one of two ways, and neither covers every case:
 *
 * | How the photo left the library | What we hear about it |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | moved to "Recently Deleted" | **nothing** — the record still exists, only `isDeleted` flips |
 * | expunged after 30 days | a tombstone in `/records/changes`, or an entry in the expunge index |
 *
 * The gap between the two — plus any tombstone missed while the app was not running long enough for
 * its `syncToken` to stay usable — leaves a row cached forever, because the incremental path never
 * says "this is gone". Comparing the whole library against everything CloudKit still returns is the
 * only statement that can positively prove absence.
 *
 * ## Conservative rule (chosen deliberately)
 *
 * Several `CPLAsset` records can share one `CPLMaster` (edits, re-imports, server-side remaps).
 * When that happens the app cannot tell which asset the user is looking at, so it must not guess:
 *
 * > **If the `masterId` is still present in the walk, every local row for that master is kept.**
 *
 * A duplicate tile the user can ignore is a far cheaper mistake than deleting a real photo. The
 * visible cost is that "looks duplicated" states survive reconciliation and must be solved in the
 * UI layer (show one item per master), not by deleting rows here.
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * The caller must only invoke this after a walk CloudKit itself declared finished. A partial id set
 * would make almost every cached row look deleted — see `MonthScanEngine`.

     * Second line of defence for a walk that reported success but is not actually complete.

     * Two real failure shapes this catches:
     *
     * 1. CloudKit answering `200` with an empty page — the walk then "completes" immediately.
     * 2. A **resumed** walk whose earlier pages were lost from `scan_seen_ids`, leaving `seen` as a
     *    suffix of the library. Measured: this purged 700 legitimate photos before the gate existed.
     *
     * The relationship relied on is simple and holds for any genuinely complete walk:
     * every cached row contributes at least one id (`id` or `masterId`) to `seen`, so a complete
     * walk always yields `seenIdCount >= localCount`. Anything less is proof the id set is partial,
     * regardless of why.
     *
     * Note this is deliberately strict (not a percentage): the earlier ratio-based version still
     * allowed a half-lost `seen` set through, because half the library is above 50% of the rows.
