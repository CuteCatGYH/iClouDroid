/**
 * Full-screen photo/video viewer.
 *
 * ## Layout
 *
 * Mirrors a native gallery rather than a toolbar-heavy Material screen: black background, back
 * arrow top-left, date/time top-right, the image filling the middle, one row of icon actions at the
 * bottom. Chrome fades so the photo is what the user looks at.
 *
 * ## Full screen and immersive mode
 *
 * The viewer hides the status and navigation bars via [HideSystemBars]. On top of that, tapping the
 * photo toggles "immersive": no back arrow, no date, no action row — just the picture. Tapping again
 * brings the chrome back. This is the two-level model every gallery uses: first tap = clean image,
 * second tap = controls.
 *
 * ## Gestures
 *
 *  - **Pinch** to zoom (about the gesture centroid, clamped so no gap appears).
 *  - **Double-tap** to toggle between fit and ~2.5x, zooming about the tapped point.
 *  - **Drag down** from fit to dismiss: the surface follows the finger, fades the backdrop and
 *    shrinks slightly; release past a distance/velocity threshold closes the viewer.
 *  - **Drag while zoomed** pans the image instead, so the dismiss gesture never fights paging.
 *
 * Paging is disabled while the image is zoomed (`userScrollEnabled`), otherwise a horizontal swipe
 * meant for panning would turn the page.

/**
 * Decides how many pages a finished horizontal swipe should advance, in -1 / 0 / +1.
 *
 * Pure so the rule can be unit tested.
 *
 * ## Sign convention (measured, not assumed)
 *
 * A leftward swipe — finger moving towards smaller x — produces a NEGATIVE `totalDragX`. This was
 * verified on a device by logging `calculatePan().x` per frame during a left swipe: every frame
 * reported about -11.5. Both parameters now describe the finger's direction of travel:
 *
 *   negative = swiped left  = next photo
 *   positive = swiped right = previous photo
 *
 * An earlier version assumed the opposite (that `calculatePan` reported *content* movement, whose
 * sign is flipped) and every swipe went backwards as a result.
 *
 * ## Why direction comes from distance
 *
 * The velocity at release is unreliable in both magnitude and sign: a finger that has flicked and
 * then settles can decelerate to nothing, or briefly rebound the other way. So the gesture's own
 * direction of travel is authoritative; velocity only decides whether the swipe was decisive
 * enough to skip the distance requirement.
