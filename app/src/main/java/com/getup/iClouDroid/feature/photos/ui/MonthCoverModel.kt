/**
 * What one cell of the jump card's month grid should render.
 *
 * Three states rather than a nullable image URL, because "no picture" has two very different
 * meanings that must not be collapsed:
 *
 *  - [Unavailable] — the month has no photos at all. Not a failure: a library simply starts at some
 *    point, and a dimmed unclickable cell is the honest way to say so.
 *  - [Placeholder] — the month *does* have photos, but the chosen cover cannot be drawn as an image
 *    (a video whose `thumbUrl` is missing, or a row whose URLs have not been minted yet). Rendered
 *    as a text cell; tapping still works.

/**
 * Builds the twelve cells of the month grid for one year.
 *
 * Kept pure (no Compose, no Room) because the rules below are exactly the ones that are easy to get
 * subtly wrong and impossible to notice on a device:
 *
 * 1. **Calendar order, not newest-first.** The grid reads `1月 … 12月`; the query returns months
 *    `DESC`, so the two disagree by design and the reordering has to happen somewhere explicit.
 * 2. **A video without `thumbUrl` must never become a [MonthCoverCell.Cover].** Falling back to
 *    `medUrl`/`originalUrl` hands Coil an `mp4` while claiming it is a JPEG; the request fails once
 *    and the cell is permanently blank (AGENTS §6.7.5c). A text cell is strictly better.
 * 3. **A month absent from [rows] is [MonthCoverCell.Unavailable], never an empty Cover.** The join
 *    is `LEFT JOIN`, so a missing month and a month with a null URL both arrive as "no URL"; only
 *    the presence of the row itself distinguishes them.
