/**
 * Enqueues and cancels the background month scan (P2-016).
 *
 * ## Policies
 *
 *  - **Network required.** There is nothing to scan offline.
 *  - **No charging requirement.** The scan is minutes, not hours; requiring a charger means a user
 *    who never plugs in sees a half-populated gallery indefinitely. Battery cost is bounded by the
 *    network constraint and the fact that the scan only runs until the cursor is exhausted.
 *  - **Exponential backoff from 30s.** A throttle should not turn into a tight retry loop.
 *  - **`KEEP` on re-enqueue.** Whichever trigger fires (app start, going to background, a manual
 *    refresh), an already-queued scan is the same job and must not be duplicated.
