 * Invalidation signals, in order of what actually causes a dead link:
 *
 *  1. **Age** — the dominant factor. **Measured on device** (SM-F9760, see
 *     `.artifacts/url_lifetime_experiment.md`): a `thumbUrl` returns `206` at 882s (14.7 min) and
 *     `410` at 1065s (17.75 min). So the real lifetime is ~15–18 minutes, not the "1–2 hours"
 *     the earlier docs claimed. [URL_MAX_AGE_MS] is therefore set to 12 min: comfortably inside
 *     the observed window, so we re-mint proactively instead of waiting for a 410.
 *
 *  2. **Session generation** — *not* a validity signal on its own. The same experiment showed a
 *     URL minted under generation N still returning `206` after a full session rebuild into
 *     N+1, so generation is now bumped only when credentials are genuinely dead (`force` rebuild
 *     or 401/421 recovery). It remains useful for the account-switch case (P2-018), where the
 *     `recordName` itself no longer belongs to the current account — and there a *matching*
 *     generation must still refresh because the row is from a different library entirely.
 *
 * On top of the proactive check, any failed load (403/410 or otherwise) triggers exactly one
 * refresh-and-retry, so we are never silently stuck on a dead link.
