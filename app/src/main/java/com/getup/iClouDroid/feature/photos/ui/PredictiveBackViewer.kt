/**
 * Wires the Android predictive-back gesture to the viewer's shrink-back animation.
 *
 * ## Why this is separate from a plain `BackHandler`
 *
 * A normal `BackHandler` only fires when the gesture *completes* — the system draws its own
 * preview and the app reacts at the very end. `PredictiveBackHandler` reports the gesture's
 * progress continuously (0..1), so the viewer can shrink in step with the user's finger and then
 * either finish closing or spring back, exactly like a system screen.
 *
 * ## The progress mapping
 *
 * The gesture's progress is inverted: at 0 the user has not moved, at 1 they have dragged all the
 * way. The viewer's own transition uses 1 = expanded, 0 = collapsed, so the back progress is
 * subtracted from 1 as it arrives.
 *
 * @param isEnabled when false (e.g. an info card is open) the gesture is left to the system, and
 *   the caller's own back handling runs instead.
 * @param onProgress called continuously with the collapse fraction while the gesture is live. The
 *   caller should apply it directly to the transition, without animating.
 * @param onCancel called if the user abandons the gesture; the caller should animate back open.
 * @param onCommit called when the gesture completes; the caller should finish closing.
